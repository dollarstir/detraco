                            <p>The Pelican Hotel is made up of individual Hotel Apartments leased back by the owners to
                                a Management Company to be operated collectively as a hotel.
                            <p>This model is very common in many countries including the UAE, the US, Europe, Asia and
                                the United Kingdom. It is a tried and tested model and one that has proven highly
                                successful.
                            <p>The Pelican Hotel is designed to serve a mixture of short and long-stay guests and
                                provides practical touches and excellent levels of service that make being away from
                                home easier.
                            <p>The Pelican business model has several advantages when compared to standard apartment
                                rentals; this model assures investors of hassle-free income, high ROI, well managed and
                                maintained units, high income potential, potentially high occupancy rates, diversified
                                risk due to pooling of income and expenses, as well as the opportunity to partially own
                                a hotel.
                            <p>This model is the first of its kind in USA and provides a hands-off solution for
                                international investors.</p>

                            <p>After purchasing the unit, the buyer is required to sign the Request for Reservation and

                                not.
                            <p>Under our system, the hotel operator will pool together the rental revenue generated from
                                all hotel units and distribute the Net Room Revenue to all hotel unit owners after the
                                end of each operating year.</p>

                            <p>Also, a unit owner can book any room except for peak periods or close-out days.
                            <p>Traditionally, the months of June, December, January &amp; convention periods are peak
